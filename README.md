Customer Management System
Overview
The Customer Management System is a web application designed to manage customer information. The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer records. It provides features such as adding new customers, editing customer details, deleting customers, searching for customers, and syncing data with an external API.

Project Structure
The project is organized into several packages:

customer.api: Contains classes related to API integration.
customer.model: Defines the data model for customers.
customer.dao: Declares interfaces for data access operations.
customer.daoimpl: Implements data access operations.
customer.servlets: Manages HTTP requests and serves as the application's controller.
customer.util: Houses utility classes.
Key Components
API Integration (customer.api)
The APICaller class in this package handles communication with an external API. It provides methods to make GET requests and retrieve customer data. In SyncCustomerServlet, it is used to sync local customer data with the external API.

Data Model (customer.model)
The Customer class defines the structure of a customer, including attributes such as ID, first name, last name, street, address, city, state, email, and phone.

Data Access Objects (customer.dao and customer.daoimpl)
Interfaces (customer.dao):

CustomerDAO: Declares methods for CRUD operations on customer data.
Implementations (customer.daoimpl):

CustomerDAOImpl: Implements methods declared in CustomerDAO to interact with the database. Handles database operations like adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving customers.
Servlets (customer.servlets)
AddCustomerServlet: Handles adding new customers to the system.
DeleteCustomerServlet: Manages the deletion of customer records.
EditCustomerServlet: Handles the editing of customer details.
HomeServlet: Manages the display of the home page, including pagination of customer data.
LoginServlet: Handles user authentication by validating login credentials.
SearchCustomerServlet: Manages customer searches based on specified criteria.
SyncCustomerServlet: Syncs local customer data with the external API.
Utilities (customer.util)
Utility classes may include helper functions, constants, or methods used across the application.

Web Pages (JSP Files)
addCustomer.jsp: Provides a form to add new customer details.
deleteCustomer.jsp: Asks for confirmation before deleting a customer.
editCustomer.jsp: Allows users to edit customer details.
home.jsp: Displays a paginated list of customers with options to add, edit, and delete.
index.jsp: The login page where users can enter their credentials.
loginfailed.jsp: Informs users of a failed login attempt with an option to retry.
logout.jsp: Logs out the user by invalidating the session and redirects to the login page.
searchCustomer.jsp: Allows users to search for customers based on specified criteria.
How to Run the Application
Deploy the application on a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat).
Access the application through a web browser.
Use the provided login page (index.jsp) to log in.
Navigate through the application to perform CRUD operations on customer records.
External API Integration
The system integrates with an external API to sync customer data. Ensure that the API endpoint, authentication token, and other necessary configurations are set up correctly in SyncCustomerServlet.

Dependencies
Ensure that the following dependencies are available in your project:

Servlet API (for servlets)
Jackson Databind (for JSON processing)
